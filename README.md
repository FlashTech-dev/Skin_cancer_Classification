# Skin_cancer_Classification
This repo contains a notenook to build a keras model which can classify skin cancer as Benign and Malignant.

The Dataset used here is available on Kaggle- [Skin Cancer pictures of the ISIC Archive](https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign/kernels)

The data consists of two folders with each 1800 pictures (224x244) of the two types of moles.
All the rights of the Data are bound to the ISIC-Archive rights (https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main). I do not take any responsibility for the right-infringement of any kernels. Thus, do not monetize this any of your models done on this data :).
